# SnowflakeMatillionDataEngineering

## Project Description

This project aims to explore the relationship between Temperature, Population, and Natural Gas Energy Consumption. Weâ€™ll Extract, Transform, Load, and Schedule data from Energy Information API, NOAA API, OpenDataSoft API & OpenWeather API using Matillion, load them into a Snowflake Data Warehouse and use Tableau for Visualization.
